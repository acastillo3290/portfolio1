## About The Project

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a passionate developer who has spent the past year at Marcy Labs honing my skills and building many projects. During this transformative period, I've learned a variety of technologies, tackling challenges that range from front-end design in React and Astro to complex back-end solutions in Node.js and SQL.

This portfolio is created to showcase my journey. Each project here represents a step towards learning software development.
As I continue to evolve as a developer, this portfolio serves not only as a reflection of my past achievements but also as a platform for future opportunities. I am eager to explore new technologies, collaborate on impactful projects, and contribute to the tech community.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find inspiration in my work!
