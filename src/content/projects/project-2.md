Eaze is a full-stack JavaScript desktop application that provides users with resources for asthma. The app offers users an intuitive interface to access the best resources for treating asthma, along with a way for users to discuss any problems or symptoms they may be experiencing. More specifically I developed the entire discussion page, from the front-end components and back-end routes.
