Throughout my capstone journey, I dedicated the first four weeks to learning Swift and SpriteKit. During this initial phase, I completed small projects and followed detailed tutorials to solidify my understanding. I then spent the remaining four weeks to developing my final, comprehensive project.
I’m proud of what I’ve built and excited for you to try it out. Download Masorchi today and let me know what you think!
