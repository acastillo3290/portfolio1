Masorchi is a Swift-based iOS 2D game.  I dedicated four weeks to learning Swift and SpriteKit. During this initial phase, I completed small projects and followed detailed tutorials to solidify my understanding. I then spent another four weeks developing my final, comprehensive project.
I’m proud of what I’ve built and excited for you to try it out. Download Masorchi today and let me know what you think!
